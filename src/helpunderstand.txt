In React, mounting is the process that occurs when a component is first rendered into the DOM (i.e., added to the webpage). 
This is the very first time the component appears on the screen, and it's when React creates and inserts the component into the DOM.


React components go through several phases during their lifecycle:

Mounting: When the component is created and inserted into the DOM.
At this point, the component is "mounted" and becomes visible in the app.
Updating: When the component re-renders due to state or props changes.
Unmounting: When the component is removed from the DOM.

The useEffect hook is often used to run code during the mounting phase (i.e., when the component first renders)
